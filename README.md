# Dino's Hyperspace Wrapper for Mac
Noob friendly Application to run FTL: Hyperspace on MacOS 
(Supporting x86 and ARM)

## Installing FTL:
At first download the [latest](https://github.com/The-Dumb-Dino/Dinos-Hyperspace-Wrapper-for-Mac/releases) wrapper. I reccomend moving it into the Applications folder.
After that you should get a copy of FTL for Windows and download the latest version of [Hyperspace](https://github.com/FTL-Hyperspace/FTL-Hyperspace/releases) aswell.

### Step 1: Inside the wrapper
Navigate into the wrapper by left-clicking on it and pressing "View package contents".

### Step 2: FTL Location
Navigate to "Drop-FTL-Here"

### Step 3: Copying files
Ensure that your FTL and Hyperspace files are prepared. Transfer them by dragging or copying them into the designated folder.

### Step 4: First launch
Congrats! Now you can launch the wrapper for the first time by left-clicking and selecting "open".

### Step 5: Finishing Hyperspace installation
After launching the wrapper it will check if Hyperspace is present and if it is downgraded or not. Downgrading is an automated process and is managed for you. 

First you will see this window stating that hyperspace has been found but not downgraded yet.

This creepy window doesn't do much, when it's done you can press enter and it will go away.

If nothing went wrong you should see this window, just press OK and FTL will start.

Note: Before installing hyperspace, make sure to patch the ftl.dat file with your desired mods. Otherwise, hyperspace will not be fully installed (temporarily).

## Installing mods with SMM:
Comming soon

## Known issues:
- Sound bugs/tearing caused by Wine.
- Longer loading times on Apple Silicon Mac's caused by Rosetta translation.
- Secondary FTL window in the dock after downgrade, fixed by restarting the wrapper.
